For Trench Crusade and other tabletop games that involve trench warfare and gritty frontline battles, I’ve 3D-printed an entire table's worth of terrain using files from the "Trench Warfare Zone" Kickstarter. The models, designed by Dani Amengual, were brought to life with drybrushing to achieve a grim, realistic battlefield look.

This terrain is now available for gaming at the [Heldenschmiede](https://www.heldenschmiede.eu/) – perfect for narrative skirmishes or tactical trench warfare scenarios.

If you want to print your own, the STL files are available for purchase on MyMiniFactory, directly from the designer [DaniAmengual](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/DaniAmengual).
